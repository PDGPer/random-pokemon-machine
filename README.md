# random-pokemon-machine
A pokemon themed version of the basic random quote machine challenge.

## Goals
A while ago I noticed I had left some fCC challenges unfinished which are needed to get one of the certificates, so I decided to get them out of the way and try out some new tools as well.

For this project, I threw Vite, Vitest and Tailwind into the mix and tried to figure out the most productive way of using generative coding tools (Codeium, in this instance).

## Conclusions

### Vite
Setup was a breeze, had no problems.

### Tailwind
Some extra steps to use it with Vite but it was no biggie. Reminded me of Bootstrap in its usage.

### Vitest
Just put together a very basic unit test to see how to set it up. App is so basic there isn't much to test anyway but I need to play around with it some more.

### Codeium
I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked as a personal assistant to do boring documentation searches. It quickly and correctly found me the Tailwind classes I needed, saving me the trouble of looking up a dictionary's worth of CSS classes to figure out how to make a button white.

Gave me one good refactor suggestion and a couple of bad ones.

Kept making terrible test suggestions that used Jest functions and wouldn't self correct despite several different approaches. I assume that frequently used and well documented tools are the low hanging fruit it usually reaches for, hence why it kept insisting on writing Vitest tests as if they were Jest.

My mind hasn't changed since I first tried ChatGPT that you generally can't trust these tools to code anything more complex than a potato.

Even if they come up with stuff fast, there is an excellent chance that you already need to know what you are doing to figure out what they are doing wrong. And if you need to do that much babysitting of a tool, you're probably better off using that time to actually know the tech you're using instead of second guessing a blackbox all the time.

Anyway, I'll keep trying out different approaches to see if I'm missing something.
